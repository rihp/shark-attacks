# Shark-attacks 
First project for IronHack Data Analytics Bootcamp


Possible Hypothesis:

- The 5 species with the most registered attacks have a similar fatalities/survivals ratio

- The activities with the most registered attacks have a very different fatalities/survivals ratio

- The 'Provoked attacks? have a higher fatalities/survivals ratio than the 'Unprovoked attacks'

- Fishers and Surfers have less 'Provoked attacks' than other victims.
