# Shark-attacks 
  First project for IronHack Data Analytics Bootcamp

## ü¶àÔ∏è Purpose
  The purpose of this project is to shed some light on a few shark myths about the danger that all sharks are humanan-killing machines. I believe that we, as humans, can live in harmony with nature, understanding that if we don't bother other species, they won't be as harmful to us as we can be to them.

  Although shark attacks are statistically very rare, they are not fiction. A substantial ammount of shark attacks, however, originate when the 'victim' is handling or bothering a shark. 
 Would you physically grab a shark to take a selfie? Some people have done so, and also have been injured in the process. So if you see a shark, I don't recommend you try to touch, wrangle, or mount it. Let them be, and they'll probably wont try to *eat* a part of you.

## ü¶àÔ∏è Overview
  There are over 400 species of sharks, and the victims of the shark attacks have been injured while performing thousands of different activities. According to the dataset, some victims were actually inflicting physical damage on the shark, or moving them out of their natural habitat. These attacks are classified as *Provoked Attacks*, and it's the theme we will zooming into during the length of this project.

**About the data:** We have used a dataset with global shark attacks, with datapoints from the past two centuries, and recorded by respected sources like the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF) and other individual investigators.

 **Data Processing**: With the use of `Python 3`, and the modules `pandas`, `numpy` and `matplotlib`, I have tried to clean the dataframe, while also generating a categorized dataset for future researchers to use. 

*The produced dataset can be found on the `/OUTPUT` directory, along with the graphs generated with `matplotlib`.*


## ü¶àÔ∏è Main Hypothesis

- **The 5 species with the most registered attacks have a higher *fatalities/survivals ratio* when these attacks are 'PROVOKED' by the victims.**

### Other possible hypothesis to consider:

- The 5 species with the most registered attacks have a similar *fatalities/survivals ratio*

- The activities with the most registered attacks have a very different *fatalities/survivals ratio* 

- Fishers and Surfers have less 'Provoked attacks' than other victims.



## üé£Ô∏è  Footnote
This project is supposed to be `forked` and followed along.  I invite you to make changes to it and submit a pull request with new ideas on how to dig deeper into the issue of Shark Attacks. So go ahead, fork it, follow along, and experiment!
